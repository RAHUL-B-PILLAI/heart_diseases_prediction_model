# Heart Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Problem Statement 
According to [W.H.O](https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases#tab=tab_1), Cardiovascular diseases are number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimate  of 17.9 million each year. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic cardiac patients fail to get immediate treatments.Carrying out tests for cardiac issues during a crisis like pandemic is also very difficult.Unpredictable nature of cardiac disorders make it all the more difficult to diagnose.

## About Project 
The objective of this project is to make the process of diagnosis easier by creating effiective machine learning model. The project consist of two different model one for quick diagnosis and another for advanced diagnosis. For both model different set of input is taken according to requirment.

## Team
* Ajay Krishnan<br>
* Rahul B Pillai(Myself)

## Dataset details
For this project we have used two different dataset for training two different model one for quick diagnosis for general user and another one for advanced diagnosis for advanced user.
The dataset we used are from kaggle [dataset1](https://www.kaggle.com/amanajmera1/framingham-heart-study-dataset) & [dataset2](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

## Conclusion 
As wearable devices are gaining popularity among the crowd. These devices can accurately measure the heart vital signs. A lot of data is being produced every minute from these devices. These all data can be efficiently processed by using machine learning algorithm. Future version of this project will a attempt to develop a device to record the heart vital and use that recorded data as input for machine learning model for diagnosis.
